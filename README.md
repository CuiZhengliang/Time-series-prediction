The project "Early Reliability Inidcator" is to predict the warranty claims' future development, so that we can sense the series issues in advance, as well as measure the vehicle's quality performance in the field. It includes mainly three parts:

1. Weibull regression for each damaged part.


2. Chi-square condidence level.


3. WTTE-RNN based on the real-time-monitoring EV data.
